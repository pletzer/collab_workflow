## Overview

Every project attempts to achieve two simulatenous and opposing goals:

 1. Allow and receive contributions from many
 2. Make sure the project's integrity is preserved

The following describes a process for working with code or ASCII documents using github as a repository. It assumes that you have registered on github and have user name `$GITUSER`.

## Collaborators and contributors

There are two main roles to be assigned in the project:

 * *Contributors* - Anyone who contributes to the project (no permission required). 
 * *Collaborators* - People who have the permission to accept changes submitted by contributors. A collaborator can also be contributor. The same person cannot submit and review a submission for changes (pull-request).

## Basic steps

 1. Fork the project repo from `https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow`. This will create your personal repo. <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/fork.png">Click here to see how to fork</a>.

 2. Clone your personal repo (i.e. download it) `git clone https://github.com/$GITUSER/collab_workflow`. <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/clone.png">Click here to see how to clone</a>. If using TortoiseGit then go to the Windows Explorer window in which you want the folder created
   1. right-click
   2. click "Git Clone...". A window will appear, if you're happy with the options, just click OK. Your personal repo will download to your computer 

 3. Create a feature branch in your personal master branch. A branch represents a topic (an idea, a concept, a bug fix, etc.) and should be named appropriately. 
    In the following we call our new development branch `new_population_assessment`. Then
    1. `git checkout -b new_population_assessment` (checks out and creates the branch). <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/new_branch.png">How to create a new branch with TortoiseGit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/new_branch_2.png">switching to it</a>.
    2. modify and `git commit -a` your changes. <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/commit1.png">See here how to commit changes with TortoiseGit.</a>
    3. push your changes to your remote personal branch, `git push origin new_population_assessment`. <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/push1.png">See here how to push changes with TortoiseGit</a> <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/push2.png">and confirm the changes.</a>

 **Working with TortoiseGit:** for the equivalent of the above commands, the right-click menu is used

 4. When the changes are ready to be merged to the project master branch:
 
 	(a) merge the master branch of the project repo to the current branch on which you're working (to pick up any changes since the branch split from project master): `git merge https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow master`
	
	**Tortoisegit:** To merge from the master repo, there are several options. We show here the basic one: <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge1.png">merge step 1,</a> <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge2.png">step 2,</a> <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge3.png">step 3</a> <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge4.png">step 4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge5.png">step 5</a>. 
		
	And now, to do the equivalent of step (a) above, we need to pull from the remote branch to our local branch (<a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge6.png">pull step 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/merge7.png">pull step 2</a>)
    				
	(b) commit your changes to the local branch, `git commit -a`, and push the local branch to your remote personal repository `git push origin new_population_assessment`
    
	(c) create a pull-request on the web site against the project master branch, justifying in the text box why the change is important what has been done/achieved. One of the collaborators will assess the change to the repository. There can be back and forth discussion, all captured in the text boxes. At some point the collaborator might agree with the change and the `new_population_assessment` code then gets merged to the master branch. Delete the `new_population_assessment` branch: `git branch -D new_population_assessment`. This is shown <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/pullrequest1.png">here</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow/blob/master/pullrequest2.png">here</a>.


## Synoptics of the workflow

The process is shown below with time advancing from left to right. A branch is shown as a horizontal line. Branches are stacked vertically. Changes/commits/merges are shown as "O". The vertical dotted line shows where a pull-request was initiated. Special actions are denoted by A, B, C, D and E:
 * A: project master repo is forked from remote, this project master is also referred as 'origin'
 * B: changes from project master are "pulled" to personal master and feature branch "new_population_assessment" is created 
 * C: changes from the project master are "pulled" into the "new_population_assessment" branch. If any, resolve conflicts arising from the "pull". 
 * D: pull-request is initiated
 * E: pull-request is accepted by collaborator, changes from branch "new_population_assessment" are merged into the project master. 

```sequence
                       v       v      v
project master   -+----O----+---O------O--+--:--O-->...
                  |         |             |  :  ^
                  |         v             |  :  |
personal master   .---------+--...        |  :  |
                            |             |  :  |
                  A         |             |  :  |
                            |             v  :  |
new_population_assessment   .-O--O---O-O-OO--O--+
(feature master)
                            B            C  D  E         
```

## Five basic git commands

 1. `git clone <url>` makes a direct copy of repository to you local machine
 2. `git add <file>` adds a file for staging
 3. `git commit -a` commits all your changes locally (your repo copy on your machine)
 4. `git push` pushes changes from your local repo to remote (personal) repo
 5. `git pull` pulls updates from a remote repo to your local repos

## How to switch between different branches

Developers will typically work with different branches, e.g. `master` and `improve_logging`. First you need to fetch all the remote branches:
```
git fetch --all
```
To see all the branches type 
```
git branch
```
You can select a given branch using
```
git checkout improve_logging
```
To go back to master, just type
```
git checkout master
```
To update yopur branch with changes from project master
```
git pull https://github.com/pletzer/collab_workflow master
```
To create and checkout new branch `<branch>`
```
git checkout -b <branch>
```

## Checking out a previous version

```
git checkout 34c8e11842
```
where the hex number can be inferred from `git status <file>` (can be abbreviated).  You can come back to the latest version by typing
```
git checkout master
```

## Frequently asked questions 

 * Q: Why should I should create a branch in order to publish (pull-request) changes? 
   * A: This allows you to work on different features at the same time, create different pull-requests, each may be accepted or rejected. Each pull request contains only the differences for the given feature, making it easier for the collaborator to review your changes. We recomend that you do not make any changes to your "master" branch except by pulling from the project "master". 

 * Q: What if I need changes not yet accepted by a pull-request in order to work on a new feature? 
  * A: Branch off from the previous pull-request branch and make your changes theres. In the pull-request message, indicate that the current pull-request supercedes the previous pull-request. The collaborator then has the choice between aceepting the last pull-request and rejecting the previous one or accepting the previous one, or rejecting both.

 * *feature branch* - a short lived branch that is created for the purpose of implementing a new feature
 * *local repo* - obtained when cloning a personal or project repo
 * *local changes* - changes that have not yet been committed to the local repo
 * *pushing changes* - updating the remote personal repo with the changes committed locally
